# 6th GRADE NEWS
## Treble Rehearsal
Because our 6th grade treble choir is across two class periods (5th and 8th), we need to join together to rehearse once before the concert. It is essential we have everyone so we can get placement on the risers correct and for students to hear what it sounds like with more students in the choir.  

**Our rehearsal is the morning of our concert, October 8 from 8:20-8:50am.**   

**This is a graded, mandatory event for which there is no make up assignment.** Please reach out with any special situations.

## All Region
![all region](/img/2024-09-29-allregion.png#floatright)  
Students wishing to audition for All Region can come to sectionals (calendar found here) if they would like extra help.  Also available is our FREE LISD All Region Camp to learn the music and feel prepared! This music is challenging and will require a good amount of individual work at home.  We are not teaching all the repertoire in every class, especially in 3rd and 7th periods. Students should practice on their own at home with the practice tracks and in their private lessons. 

If your student would like to attend the camp, [REGISTER HERE](https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FTEQRRyMfhFzoLYTp8&design=DAGPjPMYoeY&accessRole=viewer&linkSource=document) by Sept. 20.

The teal All Region Commitment Contract went home this week and is due back by Sept. 13.
