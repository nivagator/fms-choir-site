# 6th GRADE NEWS
## Treble Rehearsal
Because our 6th grade treble choir is across two class periods (5th and 8th), we need to join together to rehearse once before the concert. It is essential we have everyone so we can get placement on the risers correct and for students to hear what it sounds like with more students in the choir.  

**Our rehearsal is the morning of our concert, October 8 from 8:20-8:50am.**   

**This is a graded, mandatory event for which there is no make up assignment.** Please reach out with any special situations.

# 7th & 8th GRADE NEWS

## All Region
![all region](/img/2024-09-29-allregion.png#floatright)  
Students wishing to audition for All Region can come to sectionals after school until 4:45 if they wish to have additional help preparing for auditions.

Auditions are on October 19 at Shadow Ridge MS.  Students will receive their audition time one week before auditions and will sing specific sections (called “cuts”) of two of the three prepared pieces and sight read an unknown 8 measure example. The cuts will be released to students when we return from the long weekend on October 15.  Students must have their own transportation to Shadow Ridge at their check-in time of their audition block.  The students will sing through the cuts once all together; once they have sung through their cuts, no more singing is allowed (or they could be disqualified). Once the student has completed their individual audition, they are free to leave.  More details will be sent to students involved. 

I will email the results to everyone about who has placed into a Region Choir on the evening of October 19.  Students who make a choir will learn 1-3 more pieces of music for the Clinic and Concert on November 9.
