### What happens in the FMS Choirs each day?
On a daily basis students are singing while learning about the details of music theory (scales, rhythm, pitch, keys, tempo, and the like), music history, vocal pedagogy, and performance philosophy. This is in addition to the main focus in class of teaching each student to sing, alone and with others, by using a varied repertoire of music. Choir students at FMS have homework that needs to be completed on-time in order to receive course credit. This includes both written and performed homework, as well as quizzes and tests, in addition to required attendance at performances and rehearsals.

### How much after school commitment is there for choir?
Choir is technically an “outside of school” commitment. There are 4 major concerts throughout the year for each grade level and the occasional practice during after-school hours. Attendance at these events is mandatory. 
For most students, the performances and evening events are a highlight of their experience in choir. It does, however, require both a willingness to commit to the time and an ability to plan in order to be where they need to be and also keep up with their other schoolwork. 

### Is there a Choir fee?  
The choir program receives some funding from the school but it does not cover all expenses for music, buses, competition fees, etc. The booster club fills this gap and also helps keep the choir program running. In a normal year, we do charge a small choir fee to help keep the program running. The "activity fee" varies from year to year and 7/8th grade is typically higher. The fees are collected and managed by the Forestwood Middle School Choir Booster Club.  

If payment of the fee is a concern due to financial constraints, a payment plan can be arranged, or parts of the fee can be waived. Please email Mrs. Lavacek at lavacekk@lisd.net for the form to fill out. Ability-to-pay should never be a reason why a student cannot sing in choir, and we won’t let it be.

### What about performance uniforms? 

**Informal Uniform**  
You will wear your Choir shirt + jeans and tennis shoes for some concerts and field trips. Please be sure you have a pair of jeans that fits you well with minimal to no rips. Any shade of blue is fine.

**7th and 8th grade Formal Uniform**  
Choir dress or black dress shirt + black dress pants will be provided by the Boosters. These must be returned laundered according to tag instructions after Spring Break.  

All 7th and 8th grade students need to provide their own black closed toe dress shoes. No sneakers, Crocs, Chucks, flip flops, or strappy sandals allowed. Heels are not recommended. Families are responsible for alterations and hem adjustments.

Students wearing black pants may choose to provide their own black dress pants if they desire.
